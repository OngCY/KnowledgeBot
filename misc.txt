{"reportTitle":"Thai protesters march to royal guard barracks in Bangkok","reportContent":"Thousands of protesters marched to a barracks belonging to Thailand’s royal guards in Bangkok on Sunday, demanding that King Maha Vajiralongkorn give up control of some army regiments, the latest show of defiance against the country’s powerful monarchy and the military.\n\nThe protest came after days of rallies in the Thai capital, where a student-led pro-democracy movement that emerged in July has intensified pressure on the establishment.\n\nOver recent months, demonstrators have shaken the country by criticising the monarchy, an institution protected by a harsh defamation law, and demanding the king relinquish some of his vast power and wealth.\n\nOn Sunday evening, protesters marched to the 11th Infantry Regiment, one of two army units that the king brought under his direct command in 2019.\n\nIn a statement, protesters accused the king of having “expanded his royal prerogative in every way possible including [through] the military” and referred to the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general, as the king’s “royal puppet”.\n\nCopies of the statement were folded into paper planes and flown in the direction of riot police who stood guard outside the barracks.\n\nProtesters later splashed red paint on the ground in front of officers, referencing the deadly army crackdown on anti-government redshirt demonstrators in 2010.\n\nThe army base was barricaded with buses, which were removed by protesters, as well as loops of barbed wire. Many on the frontline wore gas masks and hats for protection, though the evening passed peacefully.\n\nAbove their heads, protesters carried a flock of giant inflatable ducks, which have emerged as an icon of the movement after they were used by demonstrators to shield themselves from water cannon.\n\nYellow ducks can be seen everywhere at recent rallies: fixed on the top of protesters’ protective hard hats, sold on souvenir stalls and worn on hair slides. At one protest last week, protesters even gave out coupons that featured a duck wearing a crown, which could be exchanged for street food.\n\nThe authorities have responded to the recent protest movement by reviving the country’s strict lese-majesty law, reportedly summoning as many as 15 protesters to answer charges in the last week alone. Under the law, anyone who “defames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir-apparent or regent” can face up to 15 years on each charge.\n\nAmong those facing charges is Parit Chiwarak, known also as Penguin, who has been accused over comments made at previous rallies. On Sunday, he challenged the king’s military power. “An army should belong to the people, not the king,” he said. “In a democratic system, the king is not responsible for directing command of the military.”\n\nVajiralongkorn succeeded his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in 2016, and has since asserted his authority, including by taking direct control of a palace fortune worth tens of billions of pounds. Last year, the 1st and 11th Infantry regiments were brought under his direct control, allowing him to sidestep the usual military chain of command.\n\nProtesters said they had also decided to target the regiment over its role in previous coups, and in the suppression of anti-establishment protests 10 years ago.\n\nAbout 90 people were killed in 2010 after the army launched a crackdown on protesters who had demonstrated on the streets for months. The military denies having used excessive force.\n\nThe recent pro-democracy movement argues that the royal family – and the military, with which it is closely aligned – must be transparent and accountable to the people if Thailand is to have a true democracy.\n\nThey have made three demands: reform of the monarchy, a new constitution, and the removal of Prayuth, who first came to power in the 2014 coup. Prayuth has refused to step down.\n\nThe palace has not commented on the protests, though the king said that he loves demonstrators “all the same”.\n\nIn a recent statement, the foreign ministry said protesters were able to exercise their rights to peaceful assembly last week “without any hindrance”.\n\nThe statement added that protesters must exercise their rights “in accordance with the relevant laws”.","reportDocid":"6","reportSource":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/29/thailand-protesters-march-to-royal-guard-barracks-in-bangkok","reportTag":"Thai Protest","reportDate":"2020-11-28T16:00:00.000+00:00","taggedEntities":["Prayuth Chan-ocha","Bhumibol Adulyadej","Maha Vajiralongkorn","Parit Chiwarak"],"summarisation_E":"Thousands of protesters marched to a barracks belonging to Thailand’s royal guards in Bangkok on Sunday, demanding that King Maha Vajiralongkorn give up control of some army regiments, the latest show of defiance against the country’s powerful monarchy and the military.

{"reportTitle":"Compensation amount for terminating HSR project cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality clause: Malaysian minister","reportContent":"SINGAPORE: The compensation to be paid by Malaysia to Singapore after the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project was terminated cannot be disclosed publicly because there is a confidentiality clause in the agreement between the two countries, said Malaysia's Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Economy) Mustapa Mohamed.\n\nThe project was terminated last Friday after the HSR agreement lapsed on Dec 31, 2020.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Monday (Jan 4), Mr Mustapa said that the compensation is \"not punitive in nature\" and is an amount Malaysia will reimburse for specific costs of the project that Singapore has already spent money on.\n\n\"We are waiting for the cost details from Singapore, and once received, it will be scrutinised before we confirm them. The types of claims made have already been agreed upon,\" said Mr Mustapa.\n\n\"However, the amount of compensation cannot be disclosed because under the Bilateral Agreement, both countries are bounded by a confidentiality clause. Yet, my team and I will discuss with Singapore to share information on the amount of compensation after it is finalised. Therefore, any figures on compensation mentioned by any party are merely speculation,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament on Monday, Singapore's Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung also said: \"The compensation amount for the termination and schedule for payment are specified in our Agreements.\"\n\n\"In addition, there is a small component of miscellaneous abortive costs for the suspension of the project requested by Malaysia that Singapore is currently verifying, before we send to Malaysia. Due to Singapore’s confidentiality obligations under the HSR Bilateral Agreement, we are unable to reveal the exact terms in relation to the compensation for the termination of the HSR Project,\" he added.\n\nMr Ong said that the expenditure for the project so far is slightly more than S$270 million.\n\nThe proposed HSR line had aimed to reduce travel time between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur to around 90 minutes by train, from the current 11 hours on existing train services.\n\nIn September 2018, both sides agreed to postpone the construction of the HSR until end-May last year. Malaysia had to pay Singapore S$15 million for costs incurred in suspending the project.\n\nMalaysia later requested a further seven-month extension to allow both sides to discuss and assess Malaysia’s proposed changes to the project.\n\nMr Khaw Boon Wan, who was then Singapore’s Transport Minister, agreed to the \"final extension of the suspension period\" until Dec 31.\n\nAfter the termination of the project was announced on Jan 1, Mr Mustapa said Malaysia will honour its obligations under the Bilateral Agreement and that both countries would initiate the necessary to determine the amount of compensation.\n\nCOVID-19 FORCED MALAYSIA TO RE-EVALUATE HSR: MUSTAPA\n\nIn his Facebook post on Monday, Mr Mustapa explained that the Malaysia government was keen on the HSR project, but the COVID-19 pandemic has forced it to re-evaluate the situation.\n\nHe noted that similar rail projects in Japan and Taiwan have proven to be catalysts for economic development and the project would have reduced carbon emissions due to the reduction in air travel between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.\n\n\"However, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything,\" said Mr Mustapa.\n\n\"This pandemic has posed a huge challenge to the health and economic sectors like we have never encountered. No one could have anticipate this pandemic and its devastating impact on the Malaysian economy and around the world. This situation has forced the government to re-evaluate the HSR project,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on earlier speculation that the HSR project will be replaced with a high-speed rail between Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru, Mr Mustapa said the Malaysian government will conduct a \"detailed study\" to determine the next move.\n\n\"Currently, any talk on the KL-JB high-speed rail project is merely speculation,\" he added.
