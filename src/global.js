In practice, however, Singapore has been supplying 16 mgd of treated water to Johor at its request. On Feb 28, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urged the Johor government and its people to speak up on what he described as the morally wrong water deal with Singapore, a rich nation. “The 1962 Water Agreement is not about who is richer or poorer, Dr Balakrishnan said. Singapore's position, a longstanding position which successive foreign ministers have reiterated, is that Malaysia has lost the right to review the price of water under the 1962 Water Agreement. Malaysia subsequently made proposals on a new price for raw water. Both sides must also discuss the yield and the quality of the water from the Johor River so as to ensure that Singapore can continue to draw our entitlement of 250 million gallons per day of raw water under the 1962 Water Agreement for the remaining 41 years of the water agreement. We are therefore negotiating with Malaysia on these issues in good faith to explore a practical, durable and mutually beneficial solution for both sides. This is like how we have successfully resolved other bilateral issues in the past. The agreement, which expires in 2061, entitles Singapore to draw up to 250 million gallons a day (mgd) of water from the Johor River. SINGAPORE - Singapore has reiterated that all parties to the water supply agreement with Malaysia must adhere to its terms, after the Johor state government announced on Friday (March 1) plans to produce its own treated water.\",\"summarisation_A\":\"– Malaysia is threatening to take Singapore to international arbitration over what it calls a water deal. Per the Straits Times, the 1962 Water Agreement between the two countries gives Singapore the right to draw up to 250 million gallons of water a day from the Johor River, but Malaysia says it's not enough. It wants Singapore to pay more per thousand gallons of raw water used for drinking and industrial purposes, as well as for treating it. Singapore pays 3 sen per thousand gallons of raw water and sells treated water back to Malaysia's Johor state at 50 sen per thousand gallons, a fraction of the cost of treating the water. If they no longer want to negotiate, then we will bring it to international arbitration, Malaysia's foreign minister said in Parliament on Tuesday. And when we reach such a level, I hope the lawmakers here will give us the support to do so. Singapore's minister in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, said in a statement Tuesday that preliminary discussions on a new price for raw water had been held over the last few months. He added that Singapore is willing to discuss the possibility of Singapore sharing the cost of pollution control measures and new schemes to increase the yield of the Johor River since this\",\"taggedReports\":[\"9\",\"4\",\"5\",\"2\"],\"taggedEntities\":null,\"chkBoxSummary\":true,\"chkBoxEntities\":true,\"chkBoxTopics\":true}"
